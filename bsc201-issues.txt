hw_start_updatemsgs (0x0011), received:
    Behaviour as expected: status updates received, stopping after ~5 s due to lack of ACK responses from host.


Send mot_ack_ustatusupdate (0x0492), received:
    hw_response (error message)
    This might be expected as there are no "ACK" type messages listed as applicable to the BSC20x on page 15 of the protocol documentation.
    I tried sending a 0x0482 instead in case there was an undocumented "ack" equivalent of the 0x0481 "mot_get_statusupdate", but with no success.

So, can request for the controller to send status update messages, but since it doesn't accept the host's acknowledgement, status updates will stop after ~50 messages.
